description: Training project for getting familiar with the MatLab Computer Vision Toolbox. Human-over-board (HOB) describe incidents in which a human falls over board and is in need of rescue. While no global statistics are widely available, research has shown that in average only around 17% to 25% of the total humans falling over board get rescued. Aligning with this, HOB incidents were ranked as the second highest influence for fatal accidents in commercial fishing in the USA. The detection and tracking of HOB includes a range of difficulties as the maritime environment is prone to various rapid change in weather conditions. Moreover, the moving of the attached camera system, due to waves, includes noise. The aim of this project is to develop a robust and efficient algorithm for the detection and tracking of HOB scenarios. For this the algorithm was divided in 3 main steps. Image stabilization, object detection and tracking as well as the distance estimation.
