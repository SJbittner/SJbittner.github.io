description: A 3-days competition for adolescents with the game engine Unity. After initiating the the GameJam in the beginning of 2022, an motivated and amazing team of my co-workers was assembled to execute it in August 2022. My role was the organizational lead of the team. As this was the first time that an event of this kind was held at the institution, everything needed to be planned and conceptualized from the beginning. After a long weekend and happy participants, the award ceremony crowned the end of the event with proud winners. Especially amazing for me was to see the wide variety of participants at the GameJam. There were adolescents with no prio coding experience and some with a lot. However, together we made it work to create an educative and fun weekend, regardless of the backgrounds. We are proud that the GameJam is now an anual event at the JuniorUni Wuppertal!
