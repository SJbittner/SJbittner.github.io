description: Advanced research project to state-of-the-art approaches for social relationship recognition in pictures.
---

In recent years the investigation of social
relationships in order to get insights into behavior and
mental as well as physical health has been growing. This project
aims to explore two new approaches for the recognition of pairs
of people to social relationships given the PISC data set. The
first approach uses extracted skeleton key-points with ViTPose
as a feature and feeds it to a NN. In comparison the second
approach builds skeleton images with the previously extracted
skeleton key-points and feeds it into the CNN ResNet-18. For this
alterations were tested in resolution and color of the skeleton, so
explore the trade-off of decreasing computational complexity and
information loss. The evaluation indicated that while only using
skeleton key-points as a feature does not perform sufficiently,
skeleton images show promising results for social relationship
recognition compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.
However, further studies should re-evaluate the framework with
cross-validation and the provided train-test split of the PISC
data set.
