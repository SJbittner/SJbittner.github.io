description: In this project we researched the effect of mindfulness-based techniques processes during the development of behavioral addictions. More specifically, we explored the effect on the gaming addiction. My role was to manage the project with 15 team members and 5 sub-groups for different tasks. Next to that, I was mainly active in research and coding of the mobile application. Based on the extensive litarture research at the beginning we concepted a german application which includes different mindfulness-based exercise, such as <i> breathing exercises</i> and meditation </i>. All exercises were developed and recorded by our team with consideration of experience and preferences of our user group. Further we implemented the concept in a two-persons group with the platform <i> React Native </i>, with no prior knowledge of mobile development. After a succesful final presentation and promising results of <i> Upgrade your Mind </i> the corresponding department decided to continue the evaluation of the application at the University of Duisburg-Essen. In my bachelor thesis, I took over part of the evaluation and explored the effect of the application after to weeks of use for gamers and non-gamers. My empirical study focussed on the cognitive functions <i> inhibitation </i> and also investigated <i> stress </i> as well as the <i> dispositional mindfulness</i>. After me leaving the university for my master's, further evaluation was still ongoing. <br> The corresponding code can be derived from <a href="https://github.com/lukas-thelen/mindfulness/">GitHub</a>. <br> You want to check the application out? Please, feel free to do so with the following link. The application is in German, as this was part of a project from a course at the University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany.  <a href="https://www-stud.uni-due.de/~smluthel/data/ ">Try it out and Upgrade Your Mind</a>.
