description: According to Poore and Nemecek, the food industry makes up over a quarter (26%) of global greenhouse emissions (GHG emissions). These emissions come from the land used to grow livestock and non-meat food (24%), crop production for livestock and humans (27%), livestock’s and fisheries’ emissions (31%) and the supplychain of food (18%). While eating locally reduces the emissions through the supply chain which accounts to 18% of food emissions, growing livestock on a farm accounts for 31% of them. But not only are there differences in GHG emissions in the process steps of food production, the differences also exist between specific food types; while a kilogram of peas emits only 1 kilogram of GHG emissions, a kilogram of beef emits 60 times more. Poultry and pork have lower footprints but are still higher than most plant-based foods, at 6 and 7 kg CO2-equivalents. Therefore, lowering the consumption of food that generates high GHG emissions represents an important step to reduce the overall carbon footprint, which is defined as the total amount of GHG emissions which are caused by an individual, event, organisation or product. The carbon footprint should be reduced, because of its warming effect on the planet’s atmosphere. The main aim of this project is to make consumers aware of the environmental impact of their daily food choices. This means that they will be confronted with their own carbon footprint resulting from their dietary habits. By interacting with an interactive table with plates tangible pieces representing food components, users will be able to experimentally try how much different food types impact the environment. The carbon footprint is then outputted in a multi-sensory, inclusive heat pies surrounding the plates and vapor tubes attached to the table. In this idea, both elements of effective learning, according to  are being used. The expressive activity that embodies the learners behaviour simply entails putting tangible food representation on a plate. The exploratoryactivity is observing how much the presented multi-modal information changes based on the contents on the plate. The design of this project was strongly based on the human perspective, founding decision on learning, memory, perception and emotions.
