description: Operation Rooms (OR) represent a crucial part of our health care system as around 60% of the patients, that are admitted to the hospital are treated in an OR. However, the nowadays OR-planning shows many deficiencies in execution, leading to high financial loses and decreasing efficiency and satisfaction for patients and hospital employees. One main source of these inefficiencies is overtime of planned surgeries. Further, the main source of overtime is poor prediction of the surgery time. This is due to the high complexity and uncertainty of the prediction. This project develops an algorithm which predicts the duration of the surgery time, with higher performance than the current hospital system of the Thorax Center Enschede. For that the data is explored. Further, pre-processing and following that feature selection are executed. Lastly, the model is established. Additionally, a small applicaton was written, in which the potential surgery time planner can input the patients data and that the outputs the predicted surgical duration.
